## About LikeMinds

### Launch In-app Community in 15 mins

> Businesses are increasingly investing in building communities as they enable P2P value creation, retention, product stickiness and referrals.

> LikeMinds is a simple plug and play, highly customisable community infra platform that helps brands build in-app communities in 15 mins. Brands can leverage the platform to build community features like group chats, 1-1 chats, activity feed, event management, resource library quickly without any engineering effort.
